Turtle Python Game Project: Devil Fruit Game       ## Open to name changes

"Travel all of the Blue Sea to reach the Grand Line and find the One Piece, the ultimate treasure!
You have 30 days (moves) to search the four seas to find the Grand Line and get the One Piece before all the ship's supplies run out! Click OK to start!"

Inspired by One Piece, the popular TV and manga series. Class group name: Straw Hat Pirates
 
## Class rubric: Game must include if/else, a loop, basic modular programming (def/main) with three functions, and some comments.

## Intentions for the program:
- Allow the user to move around  ## I coded to allow user input for right, left, forward and number of pixels to move. Open to a better, nicer way to code this though
- The user must touch all four circles (represents all the seas) to trigger the win (breaking the loop)  ## I haven't completed this yet
- The user must touch all four circles within 30 moves. A message will pop up when the user has 15 moves left, 7 moves left, and again when they only have one move left
- The user will get the option to try again if they want or quit (breaking the loop)

## Thoughts and Issues:
- I would like to give the user an option to quit the game early or mid-way if they choose to but this isn't necessary
- Welcoming any or all kinds of suggestions for improvements
- The coding for the winning one_piece() condition is buggy. It needs to register the user touching all four circles to trigger the win and end the loop (if user chooses to).
